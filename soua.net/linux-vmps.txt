I've done some work in order to provide VMPS server functionality
without requiring Cisco hardware, unfortunately, mainly looking at 

OpenVMPS <URL:http://sourceforge.net/projects/vmps/>

and Gunnar Lindbergs VQPD (as mentioned at
<URL:http://www.rescomp.berkeley.edu/about/training/senior/progs/Network-Retooling/x163.html>)

unfortunately, our switches didn't agree with either of those
implementations, and I've not had the hardware to spare to analyze
what differs. Feel free to contact me with questions, though.

There is also a report in German about VMPS/VQP
