Security and other patches for Ecartis.

A while back, I started fixing some of the (potential) security
problems with Ecartis. During that, I also fixed an autoconf/automake
build system and have now started working on a test suite.

You can help by testing the patch in
<URL:http://soua.net/ecartis.diff> and reporting any problems.
