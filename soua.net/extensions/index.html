<h2>My Extensions</h2>
<p />
For <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/Thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>:
<ul>

<li>
<a href="kbdmover.xpi">KbdMover</a> - Adds the ability to move mail from the keyboard (C-x). <p />
Features completion similar to partial-completion-mode, so you can type W/C/M to specify the Misc 
folder in Work/Company (in whatever folder or account that might be). You only need to type enough to uniquely
specify a single folder.
<p />
As of version 0.7, an autocomplete-like feature has been implemented. Comments on this are appreciated.<p />
Version 0.7 also brings Thunderbird 1.5 series compatibility.<p/>
Version 0.8 (never publicly released) added a goto feature as well as the ability to change keyboard assignments.
<p/>
Version 0.9 adds Thunderbird 2 compatibility as well as a smarter, faster folder selection algorithm. Unfortunately, 
I've thrown out the old configuration UI but haven't done the new one yet. Parameters are:
<pre>
kbdmover.copy.key - key to invoke copying function.
kbdmover.copy.mods - mods to be pressed at the same time.
kbdmover.move.key - key to invoke moving function.
kbdmover.move.mods - mods to be pressed at the same time.
kbdmover.goto.key - key to invoke goto function.
kbdmover.goto.mods - mods to be pressed at the same time.
kbdmover.suggest - suggestions to go through to find a suitable default mailbox.
</pre>
<p />
Latest version: 0.9 (April 20, 2007).
</li>
<p/>
<li>
<a href="headers-toggle.xpi">HeadersToggle</a> - Adds a keyboard shortcut (H) to toggle between different header display styles (full/normal/minimal).
<p />
<span style="font-weight: bold">TB 3 update:</span> Unfortunately, the version of Headers Toggle 
on AMO is not compatible with TB3, while I'll try to provide an updated version "soon", there are 
some things I need to look into.

If you don't need or use the "no headers" option and feel comfortable building it yourself,
you should be able to do

<pre>

git clone git://github.com/pontus/thunderbird-extensions.git
cd thunderbird-extensions/rubriker
make

</pre>
and then install ../headers-toggle.xpi.


<p/>
New features in 0.5.1: Support for Thunderbird 1.5 series. Works when using <a href="http://enigmail.mozdev.org/">Enigmail</a>.<p/>
0.5.2.2: Just bumped the maxversion for Thunderbird 2 compatibility, NOT FULLY VERIFIED!
<p />
Latest version: 0.5.2.2 (April 10, 2007).
<p />
<b>OS X users, please read:</b> <br/>
Unfortunately, Headers toggle doesn't work correctly with the search functionality in Thunderbird 2 on OS X in that it "steals" the H key. In an upcoming version, it will be possible to choose the toggle key yourself, but 
until that version is released (which is not a priority and can take a very long time, it has already taken several years...), I've decided to provide <a href="headers-toggle-osx-special.xpi">this version</a> which moves the functionality to Command-H on OS X.
<p/>
What's changed in that version is best described in this excerpt from the answer I've sent to some of the nice folks who have reported this issue:
<pre>
Although the problem only manifests itself on OS X (and is not really a
bug in Headers toggle per se), it's probably not a good idea to have the
functionality on a single (no accelerator) key. I did some code long ago
to dynamically change which key the functionality is bound to, but have
not yet gotten around to whip up an UI for it. Don't know when or if
that'll happen.

If you're comfortable editing files, you could fix it for your
installation (if you're editor is smart enough, it will let you open
archives without manually unpacking them, if not, you can unpack with
unzip, modify what's needed and use zip -u to update the archive).

One way of achieving it though would be to edit and fix it directly, if
that's an option for you. That would be done by changing
content/msgHeaders-toggleOverlay.xul (inside chrome/headerst.jar inside
the xpi). In the section looking like

 &lt;keyset id="mailKeys"&gt;
     &lt;key id="key_toggleheaders"
        key="&toggleheadersCmd.key;"
        oncommand="MsgViewToggleHeaders();"  /&gt;
 &lt;/keyset&gt;

you can stick a modifiers="alt" or modifiers="accel" in there so it
looks like

 &lt;keyset id="mailKeys"&gt;
     &lt;key id="key_toggleheaders"
        key="&toggleheadersCmd.key;"
        modifiers="accel"
        oncommand="MsgViewToggleHeaders();"  /&gt;
 &lt;/keyset&gt;

to require Command-H to toggle.

</pre>
